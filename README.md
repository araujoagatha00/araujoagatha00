### Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile

 âœ¨ My name is Agatha and I'm Software QA Analyst. âœ¨
 
I have been working as a test analyst since 2015 and I am currently part of the QA chapter of the Brazilian startup QuintoAndar. I have always been involved in voluntary works and, when I entered the area, I saw that this could be an opportunity to impact people's lives through technology. I am currently taking my first steps in the development area with a focus on the front end.
 
When I'm not working, I enjoy reading my favorite books, watching series and movies, meeting friends and drinking beer.
 
- :blue_heart: In love with HTML/CSS
- :computer: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on test automation projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with JavaScript.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about software testing, theater, traveling cheap and cool places to visit in SÃ£o Paulo.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can read any text very fast and make the best coffee of your life!

Would you like to find me?
