### Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile

 âœ¨ My name is Agatha and I'm Software QA Engineer. âœ¨

I have been working as a test analyst since 2015 and am currently part of the quality team chapter at a company in the financial sector. I have always been involved in volunteer work and, when I entered the field, I saw that this could be an opportunity to impact people's lives through technology. I am currently taking my first steps in the area of â€‹â€‹automation testing, focusing on JavaScript and the Java language.

When I'm not working, I like to read books, watch series and movies, cook, drink coffee or simply enjoy my home and spend time doing things I enjoy.

- :blue_heart: Passionate about Cypress / Codecept
- :computer: I am looking to collaborate on test automation projects.
- ðŸ¤” I am looking for help with JavaScript and Java.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about software testing, theater, cheap trips and cool places to visit in SÃ£o Paulo.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can read any text very quickly and make the best coffee of your life!

Would you like to find me?
