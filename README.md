### Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile

 âœ¨ My name is Agatha and I'm Software QA Analyst. âœ¨
 
I have been working as a test analyst since 2015 and I am currently part of the quality control chapter of the Brazilian startup Sympla. I have always been involved in volunteer work and, when I entered the area, I saw that this could be an opportunity to impact people's lives through technology. I'm currently taking my first steps in the automation testing area with a focus on the javascript language.
 
When I'm not working, I like to read books, watch series and movies, cook, have coffee or just enjoy my home and spend my time doing things I enjoy.
 
- :blue_heart: In love with Cypress / Codecept
- :computer: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on test automation projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with JavaScript.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about software testing, theater, traveling cheap and cool places to visit in SÃ£o Paulo.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can read any text very fast and make the best coffee of your life!

Would you like to find me?
